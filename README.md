### Hi there :wave:

This is Wordle game.


## How to play?

Guess the Wordle in some tries.
Each guess must be a valid word.
The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Example:
- Green color: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
- Yello color: The letter is in the word and in the wrong spot.
- Grey color: The letter is not in the word in any spot.

### This app is made with Flutter Framework.
